# Blank Subterra Project
This project works in great symphony with the [Subterra CMS](https://github.com/BerendPronk/subterra). Everything you need to know is found in it's [README file](https://github.com/BerendPronk/subterra#readme).

## Installing
Just to set you up quickly, here's how you create your own Subterra project. Begin with the following command, to obtain the necessary folders and files to your system:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/BerendPronk/subterra-project.git
```

Then enter the folder with this command (you can also rename the folder to your liking, though you need to replace the default project name to your own one in the next command):

```shell
$ cd subterra-project
```

Finally, install the core of Subterra with:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Again, everything you need to know about the follow-up setup, with the database and server settings, you'll find in the [Subterra README](https://github.com/BerendPronk/subterra#readme).  
If there is anything unclear about either of these README files, you may [file an issue](https://github.com/BerendPronk/subterra-project/issues).
